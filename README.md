<h1>📃 Recipe Finder with Database</h1>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>A Recipe Finder from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-finder-website--Ui-TZTPxN" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a> written in Next.js TailwindCSS Better-Auth ShadCN Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL. 
  
I created this project to practice my skills in Prisma ORM and Next.js. After building the user interface, I decided to add a user authentication feature using Google, Github, or account creation using Better-Auth. Each logged-in user can also add their own recipe to the site. It was a very good project for learning how to use server components in Next.js and building forms with Zod validation using ShadCN and React Hook Form. </p>
